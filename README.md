Automatic Solar Grass Cutter Using Arduino Uno

The Automatic Solar Grass Cutter is an innovative, eco-friendly solution designed to simplify lawn maintenance. Powered by solar energy, the device utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller to automate grass cutting, reducing human effort and promoting sustainable energy use.

Key Features:
Solar Power Integration:
The system is equipped with solar panels to harness sunlight, making it an environmentally friendly and cost-effective solution. The solar energy charges a battery, which powers the motors and electronics.

Arduino Uno Control:
The Arduino Uno acts as the brain of the system, processing sensor inputs and controlling the motors to ensure precise operation.

Sensors for Automation:

Obstacle Detection: Ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles, preventing collisions and ensuring safe operation.
Grass Height Adjustment: Sensors measure the height of the grass, allowing the cutter to adjust the blade height for consistent trimming.
Efficient Cutting Mechanism:
High-speed rotating blades, powered by DC motors, ensure even and effective cutting of grass.

Mobility:
The system is mounted on a wheeled platform with motor-driven wheels for easy movement across the lawn.

Working Principle:
Power Supply: The solar panel charges the battery, ensuring an uninterrupted power source for the Arduino Uno and the motors.
Control Logic: The Arduino Uno processes input from sensors to navigate the lawn and activate the cutting blades when grass is detected.
Obstacle Avoidance: If an obstacle is detected, the system stops, changes direction, and resumes cutting.
Grass Cutting: The height sensors guide the cutting blades to maintain uniform grass length.
Advantages:
Eco-Friendly: Solar-powered operation reduces carbon footprint.
Cost-Effective: Eliminates the need for fuel or external electricity.
Time-Saving: Automates grass cutting with minimal human intervention.
Safety Features: Sensors prevent accidents by avoiding obstacles and ensuring precise operation.
Applications:
Residential lawns.
Parks and recreational areas.
Small-scale agricultural fields.
This project demonstrates how renewable energy and automation can combine to create efficient and sustainable solutions for everyday tasks.
